# ReactComponent-to-nonReactApp

This assignment is to showcase using React component into non-React ES5 application

I have created React component caleed dataTable and then i have compiled and exported a file data-table.js which can be directly accessed in any Non React application

# Steps to create a bundle

1> first do npm install

2> then do npm run build 

This will create a bundle file called data-table and data-table.min.js in public folder

we are directly calling data-table.min.js in our index html file


The we start node server to serve the html file

# Start node server

1> npm run start

This will start the server at localhost:3050 Please visit http://localhost:3050/ to see results
